# How to create dynamic routes or dynamic URLs: 

-You can follow  the same steps as URLs and views, 
  but  in the path, you have to pass a variable to that function which is created in the views.py file.
- you can  pass int, str, slug datatype 
What is meant by slug: it is also a datatype that can also accept int, str, and a_dsa, this type. 
  If you donâ€™t want to put a data type name then put it empty it can accept anything.
